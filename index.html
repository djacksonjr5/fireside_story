        <p>It was a dark and stormy night</p>
        <p><b>and not a mouse was stirring</b></p>
        <p>Thunder struck the town's clock tower.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful sight.</p>
        <p>The boy grabbed the girl's hand, "Let's go!", he said. We only have 2 hours until midnight. I don't want to miss it.</p>
